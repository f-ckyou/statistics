## 🎯 What is a **Variable** in Statistics?

> A **variable** is a characteristic, number, or quantity that **can change** from one entity to another.

It represents **data that can vary** — like height, weight, age, test scores, etc. We analyze variables to understand patterns, relationships, and trends in data.

## 📦 Types of Variables in Statistics

Variables are broadly divided into **two main categories**:

---

## 1️⃣ **Quantitative Variables** (Numerical)

> These variables **represent quantities** and are **measured in numbers**.

### ➤ A. **Discrete Variables**
- Countable
- No decimal values
- Often whole numbers

📌 **Examples:**
- Number of students
- Number of goals in a match

---

### ➤ B. **Continuous Variables**
- Can take **any value** within a range
- May include decimals

📌 **Examples:**
- Height (e.g., 5.8 ft)
- Temperature (e.g., 36.5°C)
- Time (e.g., 2.75 hours)

---

## 2️⃣ **Qualitative Variables** (Categorical)

> These variables **describe qualities or characteristics** — usually **non-numeric**.

### ➤ A. **Nominal Variables**
- No natural order or ranking
- Just labels or names

📌 **Examples:**
- Gender (Male, Female)
- Colors (Red, Blue, Green)

---

### ➤ B. **Ordinal Variables**
- **Have order** or rank
- But the differences between values aren’t meaningful or equal

📌 **Examples:**
- Satisfaction (Low, Medium, High)
- Education level (High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD)

## 🎓 Other Classifications

| Category               | Examples                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Independent Variable** | What you change or control     |
| **Dependent Variable**   | What you measure/observe       |

Example: In a study of hours studied vs marks:
- **Hours studied** = independent variable  
- **Marks obtained** = dependent variable

| Variable Type         | Subtype      | Example                     |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Quantitative (Numeric) | Discrete     | No. of students (1, 2, 3…)  |
|                        | Continuous   | Height (5.5 ft), weight     |
| Qualitative (Categorical)| Nominal    | Gender, colors              |
|                        | Ordinal      | Rank, satisfaction level    |
